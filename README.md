# End-to-End-Echocardiographic-Analysis-Pipeline
***

## Introduction 
Our project aims to develop an intelligent, AI-powered pipeline that automates the extraction of key clinical parameters from echocardiographic images. By leveraging advanced image processing techniques, this system transforms raw medical images into structured, physician-ready reports.
Integrated with an interactive web application whitch  allows healthcare professionals to review, customize, and finalize reports, supporting a streamlined workflow. This system not only reduces the time required for analysis but also ensures standardized and accurate clinical information, ultimately improving patient outcomes and enabling timely, data-driven decision-making.
